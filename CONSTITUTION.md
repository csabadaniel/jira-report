# JIRA Report Project Constitution

## Project Vision
Build a high-quality, user-friendly JIRA reporting application that transforms complex project data into actionable insights through clean, accessible, and performant interfaces.

## Core Principles

### 1. Code Quality & Maintainability
- **Clean Architecture**: Follow SOLID principles and maintain clear separation of concerns
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage with comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Code Standards**: Consistent formatting, meaningful naming, and comprehensive documentation
- **Code Reviews**: All changes require peer review before merging
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with informative user feedback
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### 2. User Experience Excellence
- **Performance First**: Page load times under 2 seconds, API responses under 500ms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach supporting all screen sizes
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear navigation, consistent UI patterns, minimal learning curve
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages and loading states

### 3. Security & Privacy
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of JIRA credentials using industry best practices
- **Authentication**: Robust authentication with secure token management
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store necessary data
- **Audit Trail**: Log all data access and modifications
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs

### 4. Technical Standards
- **API Best Practices**: RESTful design, proper HTTP status codes, rate limiting compliance
- **Database Design**: Normalized schema, proper indexing, data integrity constraints
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling and performance optimization
- **Browser Support**: Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and minimize security vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and user guides

### 5. JIRA Integration Standards
- **API Compliance**: Follow Atlassian JIRA API guidelines and rate limiting
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensure report data integrity and real-time synchronization
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support multiple JIRA instances and custom fields
- **Export Capabilities**: Multiple export formats (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON)
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching to minimize API calls and improve performance
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality when JIRA is temporarily unavailable

### 6. Development Workflow
- **Branch Protection**: All changes via pull requests with approval required
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and quality checks on all commits
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated, reliable deployments with rollback capability
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning with clear release notes
- **Issue Tracking**: Link all code changes to tracked issues or features
- **Documentation**: Keep technical and user documentation current

### 7. Quality Assurance
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular performance audits and optimization
- **Security Audits**: Regular security assessments and vulnerability scanning
- **User Acceptance**: Validate features against user requirements before release
- **Accessibility Testing**: Regular accessibility audits and user testing
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across supported platforms

## Implementation Guidelines

### Technology Constraints
- Modern web technologies with focus on performance and maintainability
- Secure credential storage and API communication
- Responsive framework supporting mobile and desktop
- Database solution supporting concurrent access and data integrity

### File Format Standards
- **Git Compliance**: All text files must end with a newline character (POSIX standard)
- **Line Endings**: Use LF (Unix-style) line endings for cross-platform compatibility
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 encoding for all text files
- **Whitespace**: No trailing whitespace, consistent indentation

### Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 500ms
- Test coverage ≥ 80%
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance score ≥ 95%
- User satisfaction score ≥ 4.0/5.0

## Governance
This constitution guides all development decisions. Any changes to these principles require team consensus and documentation of rationale. Regular reviews ensure continued alignment with project goals and user needs.
